## Project Summary

### Objective
The objective of the Netflix Movies and TV Show clustering project is to improve content organization and enhance the recommendation system on the Netflix platform.
By clustering similar content together, Netflix can achieve the following business objectives:
- Content Discovery: Improve how users discover content by grouping similar movies and TV shows together.
- Personalized Recommendations: Enhance the recommendation system by suggesting content from the same clusters to users.
- Content Curation: Enable thematic content collections for easier user navigation and engagement.
- Content Licensing: Make informed decisions about licensing and acquiring new content based on cluster insights.
- User Engagement: Increase user engagement and retention by offering content that aligns with individual preferences.

### Impact Quantification

The project resulted in a deployable recommender system application for Netflix. Enhancing content curation with clustering and content recommendation with recommender system, thus increasing user engagement and satisfaction


Two clustering models, K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering, were employed to group the content. For K-Means clustering, the optimal number of clusters (7) was determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis. For Hierarchical clustering, dendrogram analysis revealed 8 optimal clusters, and the Agglomerative clustering technique was used.

In conclusion, the Hierarchical Clustering approach yielded the most favorable results, as it effectively differentiated and grouped similar content. The identified clusters can serve as a valuable tool for content organization and recommendation systems, enhancing the overall user experience on the Netflix platform.
